# Equations-Calculator-Using-Stack-and-Linked-List

This program is the second project in Data Structures and Algorithms Course. It implements a calculator system that reads equations from an input file to be evaluated. The input file can contain an unspecified number of equations written in infix form. For example:

2+(14-9)+4*[6+(7+5)-1]

2+(14-9)+4[6+(8+5)-1]  

2+(14-9)+4*[6+(7+5-1] 

2+(5-3)

Features:
---
1- Read Equations: Read equations from a user-provided input file.

2- Check Validity: Check the validity of equations, indicating whether they are valid or not. Invalid equations are accompanied by specific error messages.

3- Convert to Prefix: Convert valid equations from infix to prefix notation and print the prefix expressions.

4- Evaluate Prefix Expressions: Evaluate the prefix expressions and print the results of each equation on a separate line.

5- Print Invalid Equations: Print all invalid equations from the input file.

6- Output to File: Print all equations to an output file (output.txt), indicating for each input equation whether it is valid or not. If valid, print out the prefix expression and its result.

7- Exit: Exit the program.

Additionally, this project utilizes both stack and linked list data structures.
